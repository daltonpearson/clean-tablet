Live site is [here](http://blank-slate.herokuapp.com/).

This is a clone of Blank Slate, a party game, which you can learn more about [here](https://theop.games/products/game/blank-slate/).  It is a simple and fun game and my family has several physical copies.  I played for the first time at Thanksgiving 2019 and thought it would make a good software project to learn and improve my portfolio.  

TODO:

1.  continue adding tests
2.  continue refactoring backend
3.  allow for multiple games
